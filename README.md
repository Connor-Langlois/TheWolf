## About The Project

Oracleâ„¢ is an application built to predict the movement of the stock market.

By leveraging state-of-the-art AI LSTM neural networks and vasts amount of data, Oracleâ„¢ learns which stock features signal a rise or fall in price.

Currently, it has about a 60% accuracy in predicting the daily movement of a stock.
